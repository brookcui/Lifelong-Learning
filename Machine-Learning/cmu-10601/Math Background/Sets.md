# Sets

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of objects - each object is called an element of the set.

Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements.

A set X is a subset of a set Y, written X ⊆ Y, if all the elements of X are also elements of Y.

Some useful sets are integers Z or the real numbers R.

General form:

​	S = {expression | logical property, logical property, ... }

## Comprehensions

Set builder notation is implemented in Python.

## Union, intersection, difference, complement

* Union
  * X ∩ Y = {x | x ∈ X and x ∈ Y}

* Intersection
  * X ∪ Y = {x | x ∈ X or x ∈ Y}
* Difference
  * X - Y = {x ∈ X | x ∉ Y}
* Complement
  * ^S = U - S
  * Universe set U

## Tuples and set product

Given two objects x and y, we write <x, y> for the (ordered) pair.

Given sets X and Y, we can write the set product X × Y = {<x, y> | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y}
