# 10601 Learning Objectives

## Course Level Learning Outcomes

1. Implement and analyze existing learning algorithms, including well-studied methods for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, and representation learning
2. Integrate multiple facets of practical machine learning in a single system: data preprocessing, learning, regularization and model selection
3. Describe the the formal properties of models and algorithms for learning and explain the practical implications of those results
4. Compare and contrast different paradigms for learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc.)
5. Design experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques on real-world problems
6. Employ probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and optimization in order to develop new predictive models or learning methods
7. Given a description of a ML technique, analyze it to identify (1) the expressive powerbof the formalism; (2) the inductive bias implicit in the algorithm; (3) the size and complexity of the search space; (4) the computational properties of the algorithm: (5) any guarantees (or lack thereof) regarding termination, convergence, correctness, accuracy or generalization power.
