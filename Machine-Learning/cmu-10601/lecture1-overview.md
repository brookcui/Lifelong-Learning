# Lecture 1 Overview

## What is ML

Machine Learning/ Statistics/ Probability/ Computer Science/ Optimization

Examples:

* Speech Recognition - Learning to recognize spoken words.
* Robotics - Learning to drive an autonomous vehicle.
* Games/ Reasoning - Learning to beat the masters at board games.
* Computer Vision - Learning to recognize images.
* Learning Theory - In what cases and how well can we learn?

## Defining learning problems

**Three components** <T,P,E>:

1. Task, T
2. Performance measure, P
3. Experience, E

**Definition of learning:**

A computer program **learns** if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Problem formulation

The same task can be formulated in more than one way.
