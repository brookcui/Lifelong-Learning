## What is Machine Learning

**Machine learning** is: the study methods that improve their **performance** on some **task** with **experience**.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

data -> ML method -> intelligence

Examples:

* Regression
  * input: time-series house prices
  * learn: x->y relationship
  * predict: future house prices
* Classification
  * input: cats and dogs
  * learn: x->y relationship
  * predict: y (categorical)
* Clustering
  * input: raw pixels (x)
  * seperate: (x) into sets
  * output: cluster labels (z)
* Embedding
  * input: large dataset (x)
  * find: sources of variation
  * output: representation (z)
