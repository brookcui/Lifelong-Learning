# Useful Expressions

Notes and excerpts on useful or tricky expressions.

## Array

### Avoid overcounting/duplicates in array

```python
# Very important here! We don't use `i > 0` because we always want
# to count the first element in this recursive step even if it is the same
# as one before. To avoid overcounting, we just ignore the duplicates
# after the first element.
if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
    continue
```

```python
if nums[i] > target:
    break
```

### Rotate a 2-dimension matrix

```python
for row in board:
    do_something()
for col in zip(*board):
    do_something_else()
```

### Initiation of lists

```python
a = [0 * n] # All elements will reference the identical zero in memory
b = [0] for _ in range(n)
a != b
```

### Create a 2-dimension slice in Golang

```go
array := make([][]int, m)
for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
    array[i] = make([]int, n)
}
```

## Slice

### Remove Element from Slice by Index

```go
tmp := make([]string, len(slice)-1)
copy(tmp, append(slice[:index],slice[index+1:]))
path = slice
```

## Tuple

### Tuple with infinity length

```python
# tuple of the form (window length, left, right)
window = float("inf"), None, None
```

## Linked List

### Iterate Linked List with Two Pointers

```python
curr, prev = head, None
while statement:
    prev = curr
    curr = curr.next
```

### Iterative Link Reversal

```python
while curr:
    tmp = head.next
    curr.next = prev
    prev = curr
    curr = tmp
```

## Hashmap

### defaultdict

When key is missing, the factory function will return the default value of the corresponding type. factory_function can be list, set, or str.

```python
dict = defaultdict(factory_function)
```

### Counter

```python
import collections
counter = collections.Counter(t)
```

## Bit Manipulation

### Reduce the least significant one

```python
i & (i-1) # will reduce the least significant one
```

### Add two numbers

```python
x, y = int(a, 2), int(b, 2)
while y:
    x, y = x ^ y, (x & y) << 1
return bin(x)[2:]
```
