# Approaches

## Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithm for finding all solutions by exploring all potential candidates. If the solution candidate turns to be not a solution (or at least not the last one), backtracking algorithm discards it by making some changes on the previous step, i.e. backtracks and then try again.

(e.g. [Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/))

## Dynamic Programming

Usually, solving and fully understanding a dynamic programming problem is a 4 step process:

1. Start with the recursive backtracking solution
2. Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down dynamic programming)
3. Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)
4. Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity

(e.g. [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/))

(e.g. [Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/discuss/31666/DP-Solution-in-6-lines-with-explanation.-F(i-n)-G(i-1)-*-G(n-i)))

(e.g. [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/))

(e.g. [Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/))
