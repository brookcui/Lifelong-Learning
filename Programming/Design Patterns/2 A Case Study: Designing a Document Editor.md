# Chapter 2. Case Study: Designing a Document Editor

* “This chapter presents a case study in the design of a “What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get” (or “WYSIWYG”) document editor called **Lexi**.”

## 2.1 Design Problems

* Document structure: internal representation for the document.
* Formatting: arrange text and graphics into lines and columns.
* Embellishing the user interface: such as scroll bars, borders, and drop shadows.
* Supporting multiple look-and-feel standards: adapt easily to different look-and-feel standards.
* Support multiple window systems: independent of window system.
* User operations: provide a uniform mechanism both for accessing scattered functionality and for undoing its effects.
* Spelling checking and hyphenation: analytical operations.
