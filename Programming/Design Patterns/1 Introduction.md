# Chapter 1. Introduction

* “One thing expert designers know not to do is solve every problem from first principles. Rather, they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past.”
* “The purpose of this book is to record experience in designing object-oriented software as **design patterns**. Each design pattern systematically names, explains, and evaluates an important and recurring design in object-oriented systems.”


## 1.1 What Is a Design Pattern?

* pattern name: a handle we can use to describe a design problem.
* problem: when to apply the pattern.
* solution: elements that make up the design, thier relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
* Consequence: results and tradeoffs of applying the pattern.
