# Special Situations

## Experienced Candidates

* If a company asks algorithm questions to inexperienced candidates, they tend to ask them to experienced candidates too
* Rightly or wrongly, they feel that the skills demonstrated in these questions are important for all developers

## Testers and SDETs

* SDETs (software design engineers in test) write code, but to test features instead of build features
* If you're applying for an SDET role, take the following approach:
  * *Prepare the Core Testing Problems*
  * *Practice the Coding Questions*
  * *Practice Testing the Coding Questions*
* Strong communication skills can also be very important for testers, since your job requires you to work with so many different people
* Be aware that many candidates find it very difficult to move from an SDET position to a dev position

## Product (and Program) Management

* Generally speaking, interviewers for PM positions are looking for candidates to demonstrate skills in the following areas:
  * *Handling Ambiguity*
  * *Customer Focus (Attitude)*
  * *Customer Focus (Technical Skills)*
  * *Multi-Level Communication*
  * *Passion for Technology*
  * *Teamwork of Leadership*

## Dev Lead and Managers

* Prepare to be examined for skills in the following areas
  * *Teamwork/Leadership*
  * *Prioritization*
  * *Communication*
  * "Getting rh/ngs Done"

## Startups

* Many startups might post job listings, but for the hottest startups, often the best way in is through a personal referral
* Unfortunately, many smaller startups in the U.S. are not able to sponsor work visas
* Startups tend to want engineers who are not only smart and who can code, but also people who would work well in an entrepreneurial environment
  * Your resume should ideally show initiative
  * Being able to "hit the ground running" is also very important; they want people who already know the language of the company
* In contrast to big companies, which tend to look mostly at your general aptitude with respect to software development, startups often look closely at your personality fit, skill set, and prior experience
  * *Personality Fit*
  * *Skill Set*
  * *Experience*
* In addition to the above areas, the coding and algorithms questions that you see in this book are also very common
