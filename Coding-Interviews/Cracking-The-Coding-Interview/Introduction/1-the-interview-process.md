# The Interview Process

## Assessment of Performance

* **Analytical Skills**
  * Did you need much help solving the problem?
  * How optimal was your solution?
  * How long did it take you to arrive at a solution?
  * If you had to design / architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
* **Coding Skills**
  * Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code?
  * Was it clean and well-organized?
  * Did you think about potential errors?
  * Did you use a good style?
* **Technical Knowledge / Computer-Science Fundamentals**
  * Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevent technologies?
* **Experience**
  * Have you made good technical decesions in the past?
  * Have you built interesting, challenging projects?
  * Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
* **Culture Fit / Communication Skills**
  * Do your personally and values fit with the company and team?
  * Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

## Why

* False negatives are acceptable
* Problem-solving skills are valuable
* Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful
* Whiteboard let you focus on what matters
* But it's not for everyone or every company or every situation

## How Questions are Selected

* At the vast majority of companies, there are no lists of what interviewers should ask
* Rather, each interviewer selects their own questions
* Interviewers assess you relative to other candidates on that same question by the same interviewer, which is **a relative comparison**
* For this reason, getting a hard question isn't a bad thing
  * When it's harder for you, it's harder for everyone
