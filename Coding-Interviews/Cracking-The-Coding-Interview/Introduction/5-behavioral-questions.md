* Study this grid before your interview
* Reducing each story to just a couple of keywords may make the grid easier to study and recall
* In addition, ensure that you have one to three projects that you can talk about in detail
* You should be able to discuss the technical components in depth

## What Are Your Weaknesses

* When asked about your weaknesses, give a real weakness!
* A good answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it
* For example:
  * "Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work."

## What Questions Should You Ask the Interviewer

* Most interviewers will give you a chance to ask them questions
* The quality of your questions will be a factor, whether subconsciously or consciously, in their decisions
* *Genuine Questions*
  * "What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?"
  * "What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?"
* *Insightful Questions*
  * "I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"
  * "Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, 8, C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue D."
* *Passion Questions*
  * "I'm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about this?"
  * "I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?"

## Know-Your-Technical Projects

* Select projects that ideally fit the following criteria:
  * The project had challenging components (beyond just "learning a lot")
  * You played a central role (ideally on the challenging components)
  * You can talk at technical depth
* For those projects, and all your projects, be able to talk about the challenges, mistakes, technical decisions, choices of technologies (and tradeoffs of these), and the things you would do differently
* You can also think about follow-up questions, like how you would scale the application

## Responding To Behavioral Questions

* Behavioral questions allow your interviewer to get to know you and your prior experience better
* **Be Specific, Not Arrogant**
* **Limit Details**
  * Stay tight on details and just state the key points
  * You can always offer the interviewer the opportunity to drill in further
  * "By examing the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from O(n) to O(log n) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like"
* **Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team**
  * Listen for how much you say "we" versus "I."
  * Assume that every question is about your role, and speak to that
* **Give Structured Answers**
  * *Nugget First*
    * Nugget First means starting your response with a "nugget" that succinctly describes what your response will be about
    * For example:
      * Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change."
      * Candidate:"Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where..."
      * This technique grabs your interviewer's attention and makes it very ciear what your story will be about It also helps you be more focused in your communication, since you've made it very clear to yourself what the gist of your response is
  * *S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result)*
    * The S.A.R, approach means that you start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took, and lastly, describing the result
    * The situation and the result should be succinct
    * By using the S.A.R, model with clear situations, actions and results, the interviewer will be able to easily identify how you made an impact and why it mattered

|         | Nugget | Situation | Action(s) | Result | What It Says |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Story 1 |        |           |           |        |              |
| Story 2 |        |           |           |        |              |

* In almost all cases, the "action" is the most important part of the story
  * Where possible, breakdown the action into multiple parts
* **Think About What It Says**
  * **Initiative/Leadership**
  * **Empathy**
  * **Compassion**
  * **Humility**
  * **Teamwork/Helpfulness**
* You don't want to explicitly say, "I did X because I have empathy," but you can go one step away from that. For example:
  * **Less Clear Attribute:"!** called up the client and told him what happened."
  * **More Clear Attribute (Empathy and Courage):** "I made sure to call the client myself, because I knew that he would appreciate hearing it directly from me,"

## Tell Me About Yourself

### Structure

* **Current Role [Headline Only): "I**'m a software engineer at Microworks, where **I**'ve been leading the Android team for the last five years."
* **College:** My background is in computer science, **I** did my undergrad at Berkeley and spent a few summers working at startups, including one where I attempted to launch my own business,
* **Post College & Onwards:** After college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined Amazon as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got to really drive the launch of a key part of AWS. That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more entrepreneurial environment.
* **Current Role (Details):** One of my old managers from Amazon recruited me out to join her startup, which was what brought me to Microworks. Here, I did the initial system architecture, which has scaled pretty well with our rapid growth. I then took an opportunity to lead the Android team. I do manage a team of three, but my rote is primarily with technical leadership: architecture, coding, etc.
* **Outside of Work:** Outside of work, **I**'ve been participating in some hackathonsâ€”mostly doing **iOS** development there as a way to learn it more deeply. **I**'m also active as a moderator on online forums around Android development.
* **Wrap Up:** I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved the connection with the user, and I really want to get back to a smaller environment too.

### Hobbies

* Think carefully about your hobbies
* You may or may not want to discuss them
* Sometimes though, hobbies can be useful
  * The hobby is extremely unique (e.g., fire breathing)
  * The hobby is technical
  * he hobby demonstrates a positive personality attribute
    * A hobby I ike "remodeling your house yourself" shows a drive to learn new things, take some risks, and get your hands dirty (literally and figuratively)

## Sprinkle in Shows of Successes

* Drop in some hightlights of background
* When you think about your pitch, think about what different aspects of your background say about you
  * Can you can drop in shows of successes (awards, promotions, being recruited out by someone you worked with, launches, etc.)?
