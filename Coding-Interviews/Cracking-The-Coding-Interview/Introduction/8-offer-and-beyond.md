# The Offer and Beyond

## Handling Offers and Rejection

* Whether you're accepting an offer, declining an offer, or responding to a rejection, it matters what you do
* **Offer Deadlines and Extensions**
  * When companies extend an offer, there's almost always a deadline attached to it
  * Usually these deadlines are **one to four weeks** out
* **Declining an Offer**
  * Even if you aren't interested in working for this company right now, you might be interested in working for it in a few years
  * It's in your best interest to decline the offer on good terms and keep a line of communication open
  * When you decline an offer, provide a reason that is **non-offensive** and **inarguable**
* **Handling Rejection**
  * Getting rejected is unfortunate, but it doesn't mean that you're not a great engineer
  * Lots of great engineers do poorly, either because they don't "test well" on these sort of interviewers, or they just had an "off" day
  * Companies are often eager to re-interview previously rejected candidate
  * Thank your recruiter for his time, explain that you're disappointed but that you understand their position, and ask when you can **reapply** to the company

## Evaluating the Offer

* **The Financial Package**
  * Perhaps the biggest mistake that candidates make in evaluating an offer is looking too much at their salary
  * Salary is just one part of your financial compensation
  * You should also look at:
    * Signing Bonus, Relocation, and Other One Time Perks
    * Cost of Living Difference: Taxes and other cost of living differences can make a big difference in your take­ home pay
    * Annual Bonus: Annual bonuses at tech companies can range from anywhere from 3% to 30%
    * Stock Options and Grants: Equity compensation can form another big part of your annual compensation
  * Remember, though, that what you learn and how a company advances your career often makes far more of a difference to your **long term** finances than the salary
* **Career Development**
  * This means considering the following questions:
    * How good does the company's name look on my resume?
    * How much will I learn? Will I learn relevant things?
    * What is the promotion plan? How do the careers of developers progress?
    * If I want to move into management, does this company offer a realistic plan?
    * Is the company or team growing?
    * If I do want to leave the company, is it situated near other companies I'm interested in, or will I need to move?
* **Company Stability**
  * No one wants to be fired or laid off
  * The more stable companies are also often growing more slowly
  * If you have work visa restrictions or just aren't confident in your ability to find something new, stability might be more important
* **The Happiness Factor**
  * The Product: Many people look heavily at what product they are building, and of course this matters a bit
  * Manager and Teammates: When people say that they love, or hate, their job, it's often because of their teammates and their manager
  * Company Culture: Culture is tied to everything from how decisions get made, to the social atmosphere, to how the company is organized
  * Hours: Ask future teammates about how long they typically work, and figure out if that meshes with your lifestyle
  * Additionally, note that if you are given the opportunity to switch teams easily

## Negotiation

* Do yourself a favor. Negotiate!
  * Just Do It
    * Recruiters will not revoke an offer because you negotiated, so you have little to lose
    * This is especially true if the offer is from a larger company
  * Have a Viable Alternative
    * Fundamentally, recruiters negotiate with you because they're concerned you may not join the company otherwise
    * If you have alternative options, that will make their concern much more real
  * Have a Specific "Ask"
    * It's more effective to ask for an additional $7000 in salary than to just ask for"more"
  * Overshoot
    *  In negotiations, people usually don't agree to whatever you demand
    * Ask for a bit more than you're really hoping to get, since the company will probably meet you in the middle
  * Think Beyond Salary
    * Companies are often more willing to negotiate on non-salary components, since boosting your salary too much could mean that they're paying you more than your peers
    * Consider asking for more equity or a bigger signing bonus
    * Alternatively, you may be able to ask for your reloca­ tion benefits in cash, instead of having the company pay directly for the moving fees
  * Use Your Best Medium
    * Many people will advise you to only negotiate over the phone
    * However, if you don't feel comfortable on a phone negotiation, do it via email

## On the Job

* Set a Timeline
* Build Strong Relationships
* Ask for What You Want
* Keep Interviewing
