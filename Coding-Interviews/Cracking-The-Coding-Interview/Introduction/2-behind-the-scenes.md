# Behind The Scenes

## Procedures

* Screening Interview (2)
  * Involves coding and algorithms questions
  * An engineer will usually perform a technial interview
* On-site (3-6)
  * Lunch Interview
    * Discuss interests and ask about the company culture
  * Technical Interview
    * A combination of coding, algorithms, design / architecture, and behavioral / experience questions
    * The topics vary between companies and teams due to company priorities, size, and just randomness
* Feedback
  * After interviews, interviewers will provide feedback in some form
  * Most companies get back after about a week with next steps (offer, rejection, further interviews, or just an update on the process)
  * If you have waited for more than a week, you should follow up with your recruiter politely
  * Delays can and do happen

## The Microsoft Interview

* In a typical interview, you'll show up at Microsoft at some time in the morning and fill out initial paperwork
* You'll have a short interview with a recruiter who will give you a sample question
* Be nice to your recruiter
  * ** Your recruiter can be your biggest advocate**
* During the day, you'll do **four or five** interviews, often with two different teams
* Unlike many companies, where you meet your interviewers in a conference room, you'll meet with your Microsoft interviewers in their office
* Depending on the team, interviewers may or may not share their feedback on you with the rest of the interview loop
* **When you complete your interviews with a team, you might speak with a hiring manager, if so, that's a great sign!**
  * It likely means that you passed the interviews with a particular team
  * It's now down to the hiring manager's decision
* You might get a decision that day, or it might be a week
* **Definitely Prepare:**
	* "Why do you want to work for Microsoft?"
	* In this question, Microsoft wants to see that you're passionate about technology
	* For example, I've been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and its APIs are excellent
* **What's Unique:**
  * You'll only reach the hiring manager if you've done well, so if you do, that's a great sign!

## The Amazon Interview

* Amazon's recruiting process typically begins with a phone screen in which a candidate interviews with a specific team
* A small portion of the time, a candidate may have two or more interviews, which can indicate either that one of their interviewers wasn't convinced or that they are being considered for a different team or profile
* In more unusual cases, such as when a candidate is local or has recently interviewed for a different position, a candidate may only do one phone screen
* The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to write simple code via a shared document editor
* They will also often ask a broad set of questions to explore what areas of technology you're familiar with
* Next, you fly to Seattle for four or five interviews with one or two teams that have selected you based on your resume and phone interviews
* You will have to code on a whiteboard, and some interviewers will stress other skills
* Interviewers are each assigned a specific area to probe and may seem very different from each other
* They cannot see the other feedback until they have submitted their own, and they are discouraged from discussing it until the hiring meeting
* The"bar raiser "interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high
  * They attend special training and will interview candidates outside their group in order to balance out the group itself
  * If one interview seems significantly harder and different, that's most likely the bar raiser
  * This person has both significant experi- ence with interviews and veto power in the hiring decision
  * Remember, though you seem to be struggling more in this interview doesn't mean you're actually doing worse
  * Your performance is judged relative to other candidates; it's not evaluated on a simple "percent correct" basis
* Once your interviewers have entered their feedback, they will meet to discuss it
* They will be the people making the hiring decision
* **Definitedly Prepare:**
  * Amazon cares a lot about scale
  * Additionally, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design
* **What's Unique:**
  * The Bar Raiser is brought in from a different team to keep the bar high
  * You need to impress both this person and the hiring manager

## The Google Interview

* A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical questions
  * These questions may involve coding, sometimes via a shared document
  * Candidates are typically held to the same standard and are asked similar questions on phone screens as in on-site interviews
* On your on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer
  * Interviewer feedback is kept confidential from the other interviewers, so you can be assured that you enter each interview with blank slate
  * Your lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportu- nity to ask honest questions
* Interviewers are typically not given specific focuses, and there is no "structure" or "system" as to what you're asked when
* Written feedback is submitted to a hiring committee (HC) of engineers and managers to make a hire / no-hire recommendation
  * Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication) and you are given an overall score from 1.0 to 4.0
  * The HC usually does not include any of your interviewers
* To extend an offer, the HC wants to see at least one interviewer who is an "enthusiastic endorser"
* You do not necessarily need to excel in every interview, and your phone screen performance is usually not a strong factor in the final decision
* If the hiring committee recommends an offer, your packet will go to a compensation committee and then to the executive management committee
* **Definitely Prepare:**
  * Google cares about how to design a scalable system
  * Google puts a strong focus on analytical (algorithm) skills, regardless of experience
* **What's Different:**
  * Your interviewers do not make the hiring decision
  * Rather, they enter feedback which is passed to a hiring committee
  * The hiring committee recommends a decision which can be—though rarely is—rejected by Google executives

## The Apple Interview

* The interviewers will be looking for excellent technical skills, but a passion for the position and the company is also very important
* While it's not a prerequisite to be a Mac user, you should at least be familiar with the system
* The interview process usually begins with a recruiter phone screen to get a basic sense of your skills, followed up by a series of technical phone screens with team members
* Once you're invited on campus, you'll typically be greeted by the recruiter who provides an overview of the process
* You can expect a mix of one-on-one or two-on-one interviews
  * Be ready to code on a whiteboard and make sure all of your thoughts are clearly communicated
  * Lunch is with your potential future manager and appears more casual, but it is still an interview
  * Each interviewer usually focuses on a different area and is discouraged from sharing feedback with other interviewers unless there's something they want subse- quent interviewers to drill into
* Towards the end of the day, your interviewers will compare notes
* If everyone still feels you're a viable candidate, you will have an interview with the director and the VP of the organization to which you're applying for
* If you made it to the director and VP interviews, all of your interviewers will gather in a conference room to give an official thumbs up or thumbs down
* The VP typically won't be present but can still veto the hire if they weren't impressed
* Your recruiter will usually follow up a few days later, but feel free to ping him or her for updates
* **Definitely Prepare:**
  * If you know what team you're interviewing with, make sure you read up on that product
    * What do you like about it?
    * What would you improve?
* **What's Unique:**
  * Apple does two-on-one interviews often, but don't get stressed out about them-it's the same as a one-on- one interview
  * Also, Apple employees are huge Apple fans. You should show this same passion in your interview

## The Facebook Interview

* Once selected for an interview, candidates will generally do one or two phone screens
* Phone screens will be technical and will involve coding, usually an online document editor
* After the phone interview(s), you might be asked to do a homework assignment that will include a mix of coding and algorithms
  * If you've never worked in an environment which had thorough code reviews, it may be a good idea to get someone who has to review your code
* During your on-site interview, you will interview primarily with other software engineers, but hiring managers are also involved whenever they are available
* Each interviewer is given a"role" during the on-site interviews, which helps ensure that there are no repetitive questions and that they get a holistic picture of a candidate. These roles are
  * Behavioral ("Jedi"): This interview assesses your ability to be successful in Facebook's environment
  * Coding and Algorithms ("Ninja"):
    * These are your standard coding and algorithms questions, much like what you'll find in this book
    * These questions are designed to be challenging
    * You can use any programming language you want
  * Design / Architecture ("Pirate"):
    * For a backend software engineer, you might be asked system design questions
    * Front-end or other specialties will be asked design questions related to that discipline
* You can typically expect two "ninja" interviews and one "jedi" interview.
* Experienced candidates will also usually get a "pirate" interview
* After your interview, interviewers submit written feedback, prior to discussing your performance with each other
* Once everyone's feedback is submitted, your interviewing team and a hiring manager get together to collaborate on a final decision
  * They come to a consensus decision and submit a final hire recommendation to the hiring committee
* **Definitely Prepare:**
  * Facebook wants developers with an entrepreneurial spirit
  * In your interviews, you should show that you love to build stuff fast
  * They want to know you can hack together an elegant and scalable solution using any language of choice
* **What's Unique:**
  * Facebook interviews developers for the company "in general," not for a specific team
  * If you are hired, you will go through a six-week "bootcamp" which will help ramp you up in the massive code base
  * You'll get mentorship from senior devs, learn best practices, and, ultimately, get a greater flexibility in choosing a project than if you were assigned to a project in your interview
