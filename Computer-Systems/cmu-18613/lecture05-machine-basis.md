# Lecture 05 Machine-Level Programming I: Basics

## History if Intel processors and architectures

* x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
* Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
* Processor technology dimension = width of narrowest wires (10nm â‰ˆ 100atoms wide)

## Assembly Basics

* Architecture: (a.k.a. instruction set architecture)
  * Machine code: The byte-level programs that a processor executes
  * Assembly code: A text representation of machine code
* Microarchitecture: Implementation of the architectur
* Programmer-Visible State
  * PC: Program counter
    * Address of next instruction
    * Called "RIP" (x86-64)
  * Register file
    * Heavily used program data
  * Condition codes
    * Stores status information about most recent arithmetic or logical operation
    * Used for conditional branching
  * Memory
    * Byte addressable array
    * Code and user data
    * Stack to support procedures
* Data Types
  * Integer data of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes
    * Data values
    * Addresses (untyped pointers)
  * Floating point data of 4, 8, or 10 bytes
  * SIMD vector data types of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bytes
  * Code: Byte sequences encoding series of instructions
  * No aggregate types such as arrays or structures

### Registers

* rax
* rbx
* rcx
* rdx
* rsi
* rdi
* rsp
* rbp
* r8
* r9
* r10
* r11
* r11
* r12
* r13
* r14
* r15

* eax accumulate
* ecx counter
* edx data
* ebx base
* esi source index
* edi destination index
* esp stack pointer
* ebp base pointer

### Operations

* Transfer data
* Perform arithmetic function on register or memory data
* Transfer control

### Memory

* Normal (R) Mem[Reg[R]]
* Displacement D(R) Mem[Reg[R]+D]
* Most general form D(Rb, Ri, S) Mem[Reg[Rb]+S*Reg[Ri]+D]
