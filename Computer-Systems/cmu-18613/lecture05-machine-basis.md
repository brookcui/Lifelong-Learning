# Lecture 05 Machine-Level Programming I: Basics

## History if Intel processors and architectures

* x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
* Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
* Processor technology dimension = width of narrowest wires (10nm â‰ˆ 100atoms wide)

## Assembly Basics

* Architecture: (a.k.a. instruction set architecture)
  * Machine code: The byte-level programs that a processor executes
  * Assembly code: A text representation of machine code
* Microarchitecture: Implementation of the architectur
* Programmer-Visible State
  * PC: Program counter
    * Address of next instruction
    * Called "RIP" (x86-64)
  * Register file
    * Heavily used program data
  * Condition codes
    * Stores status information about most recent arithmetic or logical operation
    * Used for conditional branching
  * Memory
    * Byte addressable array
    * Code and user data
    * Stack to support procedures
* Data Types
  * Integer data of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes
    * Data values
    * Addresses (untyped pointers)
  * Floating point data of 4, 8, or 10 bytes
  * SIMD vector data types of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bytes
  * Code: Byte sequences encoding series of instructions
  * No aggregate types such as arrays or structures

### Registers

* rax
* rbx
* rcx
* rdx
* rsi
* rdi
* rsp
* rbp
* r8
* r9
* r10
* r11
* r11
* r12
* r13
* r14
* r15

* eax accumulate
* ecx counter
* edx data
* ebx base
* esi source index
* edi destination index
* esp stack pointer
* ebp base pointer

### Operations

* Transfer data
* Perform arithmetic function on register or memory data
* Transfer control

### Memory

* Normal (R) Mem[Reg[R]]
* Displacement D(R) Mem[Reg[R]+D]
* Most general form D(Rb, Ri, S) Mem[Reg[Rb]+S*Reg[Ri]+D]

## Arithmetic & Logical Operations

* leaq Src, Dst
  * Src is address mode expression
  * Set Dst to address denoted by expression
* addq
* subq
* imulq
* shlq
* sarq
* shrq
* xorq
* andq
* orq
* **Watch out for argument order! Src, Dest**
* Warning: Intel docs use "op Dest, Src"
* incq
* decq
* negq
* notq

## C, Assemble, Machine Code

### Turning C into Object Code

* Code in files `p1.c` `p2.c`
* Compile with command: `gcc -Og p1.c p2.c -o p`
  * Use basic optimizations (`-Og`)
  * Put resulting binary in file

Text C program --Compiler (`gcc -Og -S`)-> text Asm program (`p1.s` `p2.s`) --(Assembler (`gcc` or `as`))-> binary Object program (`p1.o` `p2.o`) --(Linker (`gcc` or `ld`))-> binary Executable program (`p`) <- Static libraries (`.a`)

### Disassembling Object Code

* `objdump -d sum`
  * Can be run on either a.out (complete executable) or .o file
* gdb dump disassemble sumstore
