# 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

An algorithm is a tool for solving a well-specified **computational problem**.

Here is how we formally define the **sorting problem**:
> **Input:** A sequence of n numbers $<a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n>$
>
> **Output:** A permutation (reordering) $<a'_1,a'_2,\cdots,a'_n>$ of the input sequence such that $a'_1\leq a'_2\leq\cdots\leq a'_n$

A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

The differences due to algorithms efficiency can be much more significant than diffrences due to hardware and software.
