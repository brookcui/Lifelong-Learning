# Chapter 1. Introduction

* “Learning the art of programming, like most other disciplines, consists of first learning the rules and then learning when to break them.”
* “For the most part, this book is not about performance. It is about writing programs that are clear, correct, usable, robust, flexible, and maintainable.”
* Terms
  * The language supports four kinds of types: `interfaces` (including `annotations`), `classes` (including `enums`), `arrays`, and `primitives`. The first three are known as `reference` types. Class instances and arrays are `objects`; primitive values are not.
  * A class’s `members` consist of its `fields`, `methods`, `member classes`, and `member interfaces`.
  * A method’s `signature` consists of its name and the types of its formal parameters; the signature does not include the method’s return type.
  * Classes, interfaces, constructors, members, and serialized forms are collectively known as `API elements`. An exported API consists of the API elements that are accessible outside of the package that defines the API.
